# Automata Theory Explorer

Automata Theory Explorer is a modern, interactive web application for visualizing and simulating concepts in automata theory, including DFA, CFG, and PDA. Built for students and educators, it provides tools to explore formal languages, run simulations, and validate strings in a user-friendly interface.

## Overview
This project allows users to:
- Visualize Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), Context-Free Grammars (CFG), and Pushdown Automata (PDA)
- Simulate automata with custom input strings
- Validate strings against automata
- Explore regular expressions and their automata representations
- Learn about automata theory interactively

## Features
- **Interactive Table:** Quickly view and select between DFA, CFG, and PDA representations
- **Visualization:** Graphical rendering of automata and grammars
- **Simulation:** Step-by-step simulation and validation of input strings
- **Contact & Team:** Meet the developers and reach out via the Contact Us page
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, accessible, and visually appealing design

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fame2332/Gab-Group_automata
   cd (location)
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**
